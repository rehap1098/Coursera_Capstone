    "What do you think of when you think of shopping? Probably a mall, right? In most areas, rural and urban, a shopping mall is the primary location for folks to walk around, purchase items, and sometimes even have a meal. For this project, we're going to determine where is the best place to open a mall in the Greater Boston Area. The most famous mall in the city itself is perhaps Copley Place in the Back Bay neighborhood which features stores that range from Tiffany & Co. to Lucky Brand, but is Back Bay *really* the best place to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Greater Boston Area continues to expand and develop into its surrounding neighborhoods such as Dorchester, Roxbury, etc., this information will become relevant and can even be manipulated to target the development of movie theaters, housing complexes, etc. instead of malls. Therefore, the target audience of this report will be developers and investors that are looking to profit on the production of such development. Having this information could not only promote development, but also drive profits for investors. According to Norada Real Estate Investments, the average housing prices in Boston are increasing by about 5.7% per year. This might not seem like much until you realize that the most expensive neighborhood of Beacon Hill has an median housing price of over $2 million dollars. Having such information, but for all neighbors can let investors know if its really worth placing a mall in an area where housing is so expensive. "
